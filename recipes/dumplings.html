    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>A <strong>dumpling</strong> is a small mass of dough that can be boiled, fried, baked, or steamed. There are a ton of dumpling varieties out there, from <em>pork-</em> and <em>cabbage-filled Chinese dumplings</em> to cheesy Polish dumplings.</p>    
    <p>These boiled drop <strong>dumplings</strong>, which are popular in the U.S., are often paired with <em>chicken and broth</em> to create a popular comfort food called chicken and dumplings.</p>
    <p>They're prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew. The starch in the dumplings thickens the broth, resulting in a rich stew that's impossible to resist.</p>
    <h2>History of Dumplings</h2>
    <p>According to legend, during the Eastern Han Dynasty, there lived a famous physician of Traditional Chinese Medicine, named Zhang Zhongjing, who introduced dumplings. 1,800 years back, the “medical saint” was returning to his ancestral village after a long period of absence. During that winter, the febrile disease was turning into an epidemic. Many poor people and his fellow citizens submitted to the cold weather because of the lack of warm clothes and sufficient food and suffered frostbite, mainly around their ears. Seeing their condition, Zhang was determined to do something to get them rid of the frostbite.</p>

    <p>He cooked lamb, black peppers and a few medicinal herbs, shredded them and wrapped it in the scrape of dough skin. He shaped them like ears and boiled them. Everyone ill were given two ‘ears’ along with a bowl of warm soup. After a few days, the frostbite was gone and the epidemic was under control. Since then, most people begin imitating Zhang’s recipe with additional ingredients like vegetables and other kinds of meat to celebrate Chinese New Year.</p>
    <p>A doctor in China, Wang Lingxiang talks about how apart from having a wonderful taste, Zhang’s recipe can help promote blood flow and thaw cold ears.</p>
    <p>Chinese archaeologists found a bowl of jiaozi in the tombs of Tang Dynasty in Turpan. Since jiaozi also resembled gold and silver ingots that were used as currency during the Ming dynasty, serving them was believed to bring prosperity. Families love to have them at midnight on Chinese New Year’s Eve. Some of them even hide a clean coin inside the jiaozi for the fortunate one to find it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredient List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Flour</h4>
            <p>These <strong>dumplings</strong> start with all-purpose flour, which creates structure and holds the other ingredients together.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Baking Powder</h4>
            <p><em>Baking powder</em> is a leavening agent, which means it releases gas that makes the dough expand. It's responsible for the dumplings' light and fluffy texture.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>White Sugar</h4>
            <p>A teaspoon of sugar adds an extremely subtle hint of sweetness. It also helps the dumplings retain their moisture through the cooking process and slows gluten development, which ensures tender dumplings.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Salt</h4>
            <p>A pinch of salt seasons the dumplings and enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Butter or Margarine</h4>
            <p>Cold butter or margarine is cut into the flour mixture to bind the dry ingredients together. It also keeps the dumplings light and tender.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Milk</h4>
            <p>Whole milk helps create a smooth, moist dough.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
