    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Simply put, <strong>ramen</strong> is a Japanese noodle soup, with a combination of a rich flavoured broth, one of a variety of types of noodle and a selection of meats or vegetables, often topped with a boiled egg. In Japan ramen is considered a <em>fast food</em>, with many small restaurants and street vendors offering a warming bowl of this delicious soup.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>We begin our story a long time ago so fasten your seat belts for a whistle stop tour of ramen history! <em>It starts in 1800s China, which is considered to be the birthplace of all things ramen. The idea of noodles in a soupy broth travelled with Chinese immigrants in the late 19th or early 20th Century to Japan after the Meijiichin [Meiji Restoration] in 1868.</em> On arriving in Japan Chinatowns sprung up like the one in Yokohama - a busy port town that helped to spread the popularity of ramen throughout Japan.</p>
